# Private-Cloud-Storage

### Intention
Other than very minor cloud usage I have no experience with any cloud service so i though making and configuring my own private cloud would give me a better understanding of the system. I made a youtube video on part of the process here ðŸ”— **Reference:** [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMgL5Ng5fzU).  

### Hardware + Software
I'm using an old toshiba laptop from ~2010 to run the ubuntu server on which the cloud storage application will run. I then have two other laptops which i can use as end nodes to acctually access the cloud application. Assume relevant internet connection harwdware (aka router from ISP) but everyone has that so :). Nextcloud is an opensource cloud application that has commercial uses so its patched frequently. 

## Software Install
### Ubuntu Server
